# This is a test task for the VueJs data Grid

This is a very basic VueJs application to showcase the Data Grid implementation using native VueJs implementation, without any custom plugins.

## HOW TO
To run the code locally simply start the VueJs application and see it in the browser. Data is dynamically loaded from an external API

```
$cd vuegridtest

$npm i
// or
$yarn i
// or
$pnpm i
// then start the Vue application
$npm run serve
// or
$yarn serve
// or
$npm run dev  # common for Vite-based projects
// or
$yarn dev    # common for Vite-based projects
```

open tha application in your browser: e.g. navigate to http://localhost:8080
